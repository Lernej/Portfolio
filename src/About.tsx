            I'm a first year computer science student at the University of
            Central Florida Burnett Honors College. I'm interested in pursuing a
            career in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, or
            Cybersecurity.

            Why did I choose to study Computer Science?
          </p>
          <p className="text-left text-xl">
            Sparked by my love of video games, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by
            how software works. In high school, taking AP Computer Science
            Principles and AP Computer Science A gave me the chance to explore
            this interest. The excitement I felt while working on projects in
            those classes confirmed that I wanted to study CS in college.

            Outside of computer science, I love playing Magic: The Gathering,
            distance running, working out, and playing video games!
